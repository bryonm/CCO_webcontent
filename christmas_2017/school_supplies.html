                <div class="project_box_row_text">
                    <p>When a family is scraping by on less than $2 a day, some needs must be sacrificed so they can put food
                        on the table. Often, that need is education. Even in communities where free public schooling is available,
                        the poorest families cannot afford the required books, stationery, pencils and other supplies.
                        <br />
                        <br /> As a result, their children grow up illiterate and unable to break free from the cycle of poverty.
                        This Christmas, give a child hope for the future by providing the school supplies he or she desperately
                        needs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$12 can send a full year&rsquo;s worth of much-needed supplies for one child.</span>
                        </strong>
                        This gift, which includes such items as paper, spiral notebooks, pens, pencils and crayons, can radically transform a life!
                        Just as food nourishes the body, an education nourishes the mind, equipping the young for success.

                <em>Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for Christmas Catalog School Supplies
                    incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that
                    more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to
                    meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.
