                    <p>At the St. Martin&rsquo;s home for the aged, Christ&rsquo;s love is felt around every corner. This special
                        project responds to the need of a great number of elderly people living in the countryside who do
                        not have family or other caregivers to take care of them. The home provides care and support to the
                        elderly, meeting all physical needs such as food, medication and hygiene. To achieve optimum care,
                        The Diocese and the Morains feed the residents three hearty meals each day. They maintain a pleasant,
                        sanitary environment by keeping hygiene and cleaning supplies on hand. They ensure the staff members
                        who care for the daily needs of the residents are paid adequately and on time. And like them, Cross
                        Catholic is devoted to the well-being of the elderly in Grenada &mdash; but we need your commitment
                        as well.
                        <strong>Help us supply this nursing home materially and spiritually, allowing each resident to know that
                            Christ will carry them through their golden years.</strong>

                    incurred through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that
                    more funds are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to
                    meet the most urgent needs of the ministry.
