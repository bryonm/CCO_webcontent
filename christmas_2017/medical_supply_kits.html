                            <em>$65, send a Medical Supply Kit packed with items to treat 50 or more sick and injured patients.</em>
                        </strong>
                        <br />
                        <br /> These kits are essential to the work of Catholic doctors and volunteers serving the destitute in
                        developing countries around the world. Oftentimes, they treat patients in villages so remote that
                        even the most basic supplies &ndash; such as bandages or Aspirin &ndash; are unavailable to those
                        who desperately need them. In such places, something as simple as an infected cut can be a death
                        sentence.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Your gift of a Medical Supply Kit will ensure that health care providers are able to bring relief
                        to children, mothers, fathers, the elderly and other vulnerable individuals suffering from illness
                        and injury.
