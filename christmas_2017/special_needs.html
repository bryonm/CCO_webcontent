                <div class="project_box_row_text">
                    <p>In Ethiopia, poverty and social stigma prevent children with disabilities from getting the care they
                        need. Instead, they and their parents endure discrimination, scorn and rejection.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Through the Community-Based Rehabilitation program, the Brothers of Good Works provide these mentally
                        and physically disabled children with desperately needed support, including physical therapy, medical
                        referrals and nutritious food.
                        <br />
                        <br /> The program empowers the parents of special-needs children through income-generation projects, psychological
                        counseling, financial help and education. The program also employs community outreaches to change
                        negative attitudes about the disabled, so the children and their families are accepted and encouraged
                        rather than isolated.
                        <strong>Share Christ&rsquo;s unconditional love to special-needs children and their families this Christmas.</strong>

                <em>Proceeds from this campaign will be used to cover any expenditures for Special Deeds for Special Needs incurred
                    through June 30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that more funds
                    are raised than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the
                    most urgent needs of the ministry.
