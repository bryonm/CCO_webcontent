                    <p>Cross Catholic Outreach has partnered with Rainbow Network&rsquo;s feeding centers in order to reduce
                        malnutrition in rural Nicaragua and encourage children to remain in school. Nicaragua is plagued
                        with poverty: poor living conditions, low graduation rates, and a lack of food and clean water.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Extreme poverty has left many children and pregnant mothers without daily nutritious meals. Without
                        the school lunches distributed by Rainbow Network, most children in La Paz Centro will drop out before
                        high school and remain trapped in poverty. Their health will continue to suffer and their future
                        will be greatly limited. Your gift can help answer the prayers of 1,447 hungry children and mothers.
                        As they benefit from healthy meals six days per week, Rainbow Network doctors will help nurture them
                        back to good condition.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Healthy, well-fed children will remain in school and can concentrate in classes, allowing more kids
                        in La Paz Centro to receive a quality education and pursue better opportunities for their future.
                        <strong>Your gift today will help feed hundreds of children and nursing mothers for an entire year through
                            Rainbow Network&rsquo;s feeding centers!</strong>

                    30, 2018, the close of our ministry&rsquo;s new fiscal year. In the event that more funds are raised
                    than needed to fully fund the project, the excess funds, if any, will be used to meet the most urgent
                    needs of the ministry.
